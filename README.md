## 🚀 Quick Start

### 🪟 Windows Users
1.  **Clone/Download** this repository.
2.  Double-click **`Generate Shortcut.bat`**.
    *   *This will check for Node.js, install it if missing, and create a Desktop Shortcut.*
3.  Launch the **"Schema Editor"** shortcut.

### 🍎 Mac / 🐧 Linux Users
1.  Open your terminal in the project folder.
2.  Run the setup script:
    ```bash
    chmod +x "Generate Shortcut.sh" tools/*.sh
    ./"Generate Shortcut.sh"
    ```
3.  Launch the app or run `npm start` manually.

---

## 💻 Installation & Setup

If you prefer a manual developer setup:

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (LTS version recommended).
2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *Note: The project uses minimal dependencies, primarily for a local development server.*
3.  **Run Locally**:
    ```bash
    npx serve .
    ```
    or use the Python alternative:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server 8000
    ```
4.  Open `http://localhost:3000` (or `8000`) in **Google Chrome**, **Edge**, or **Opera** (Browsers with File System Access API support).

## 🔧 Utility Scripts (Windows)

The repository includes helper scripts in the root directory to simplify setup and maintenance.

### `Generate Shortcut.bat`
*   **What it does**: Creates a desktop shortcut named **"Schema Editor"** for easy access.
*   **Node.js Check**: It automatically checks if [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed. If missing, it can attempt to install it via `winget` or direct you to the download page.
*   **Icon**: Assigns a custom MediXtract icon to the shortcut.

### `Update Program.bat`
*   **What it does**: Updates the application to the latest version from GitHub.
*   **Smart Update**: 
    *   If you cloned via **Git**: It runs `git pull` (via reset/stash) to sync with the repository.
    *   If you downloaded the **ZIP**: It downloads the latest ZIP, extracts it, and updates your files.
*   **Data Preservation**: **CRITICAL** - This script explicitly **protects your `projects/` directory**. It will *never* overwrite or delete your local analysis and validation data during an update.

## 📁 Project Structure

For the editor to function primarily, your data must follow a strict directory structure inside the `projects/` folder. This ensures the **Project Manager** can auto-link Analysis files with their corresponding Validation and Output data.

```text
projects/
└── [project_name]_project/                 <-- Folder MUST end in '_project'
    ├── analysis_data/
    │   └── [name]-analysis_data.json       <-- The Schema Definition (Source of Truth)
    ├── validation_data/
    │   ├── patient_A-validation_data.json  <-- Human Verified Data (Ground Truth)
    │   └── patient_B-validation_data.json
    └── medixtract_output/
        ├── patient_A-output.json           <-- AI Extracted Data
        └── patient_B-output.json
```

*   **Analysis Data**: Defines the structure (fields, types, groups).
*   **Validation Data**: The "Correct" answers provided by human reviewers.
*   **MediXtract Output**: The raw output from the extraction engine.

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Dashboard & Project Selection
Upon launch, the **Projects Dashboard** displays all detected projects.
*   **Scanning**: Click "Rescan System" to refresh the list from your local disk.
*   **Recent**: Your last edited project is pinned for quick access.
*   **New Project**: Use the "Add New Project" wizard to initialize a new folder structure.

### The Schema Editor
The main view is a high-density data grid.
*   **Search**: Use the top bar to fuzzy-search field names, descriptions, or comments.
*   **Columns**:
    *   **Status**: Color-coded indicator (Green=Matched, Red=Issue, Blue=Improved).
    *   **Field Name**: The unique identifier of the data point.
    *   **Human Output**: The value found in `validation_data`.
    *   **MediXtract Output**: The value found in `medixtract_output`, with frequency counts if multiple outputs exist.
    *   **Review Switch**: A toggle to mark a field as "Reviewed" (independent of its match status).

### Validation Workflow
1.  **Select a Field**: Click any row to open the **Detail Panel**.
2.  **Compare Data**: View the AI's output distribution vs the Human truth.
3.  **Assign Status**:
    *   If the AI is correct manually, mark as **Matched**.
    *   If the AI found new valid data, mark as **Improved → Filled Blank**.
    *   If the AI is wrong, mark as **Issued → Correction**.
4.  **Edit Schema**: If the field definition is wrong, update the **Description** or **Group** directly in the panel.
5.  **Save**: Click "Save Changes" in the header to write the updated statuses back to the `analysis_data.json` file.

### Status Definitions

| Status | Icon Color | Definition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pending** | ⚪ Grey | Comparison not yet analyzed. Default state. |
| **Matched** | 🟢 Green | AI Output matches Human Validation (>90% confidence). |
| **Improved** | 🔵 Blue | AI found valid data that was missing or incorrect in Human Validation. |
| **Issued** | 🔴 Red | AI Output is incorrect or contradictory. |
| **Dismissed** | ⚫ Black | Field is not relevant for the current analysis context. |

*Sub-statuses for Improvements/Issues allow for detailed error categorization (e.g., Structural Error, Formatting Issue, Ambiguous).*

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

The application is built as a **Single Page Application (SPA)** using modern Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).

*   **View Layer**: No framework (React/Vue). Direct DOM manipulation via `TableRenderer.js` and `UIComponentRenderer.js` for maximum performance with large datasets (1000+ rows).
*   **State Management**: `DataManager.js` acts as the central store, handling data normalization and cross-referencing between the three data sources.
*   **CSS Architecture**:
    *   **BEM Naming Convention**: For maintainable styles.
    *   **Modular CSS**: Located in `css/layouts/` and `css/components/`.
    *   **Variables**: `css/variables.css` defines the theme tokens (colors, spacing) allowing for instant theme switching.
*   **Persistence**: Uses `IndexedDB` to store file handles, allowing the app to "remember" access permissions between reloads.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

The `js/projects-config.js` file acts as a fallback or pre-configuration map.
*   It is automatically generated by the `ProjectManager.js` when running in a file-system aware context.
*   It allows the app to know where files are located even if the directory scan hasn't run yet (useful for hosted demos).

## 🤝 Contributing

1.  **CSS**: When adding styles, do not edit `base.css`. Create or update a specific file in `css/components/` (for buttons, cards) or `css/layouts/` (for page structures).
2.  **Logic**: Core logic resides in `js/modules/`. Always ensure `DataManager.js` changes propagate to the UI modules via the `PanelStateManager`.
